        "To set up a hydroponic garden for herbs, I recommend starting with a simple, manual system that uses natural materials and minimal technology. You can begin by building a wooden frame using locally sourced wood and constructing a series of small, individual growing chambers. Each chamber should have a small water reservoir and a wicking system to deliver nutrients to the roots of the plants.\n\nYou can use a combination of natural and synthetic materials to create a nutrient-rich growing medium, such as a mix of peat moss, perlite, and vermiculite. Add a balanced fertilizer made from natural sources, such as fish emulsion or compost tea, to provide essential nutrients for the plants.\n\nTo maintain the system, you'll need to monitor the pH levels and adjust the nutrient solution as needed.
